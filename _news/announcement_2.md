This is a special day for me because I am participating in the graguation ceremony, and this is my last day in Sichuan University.

Tomorrow morning, I will leave Sichuan University, Chengdu, and this place that I have already considered half my home. When I came back to pack my luggage after dinner tonight, I heard my roommate reminiscing about interesting things from the past, and tears silently flowed out. 

Four years have passed in a flash, and reason occasionally reminds me that college life is over, but emotionally it is still difficult to react and accept such a fact. I feel that a part of me has been scattered here and can no longer be taken away. At this moment, Chengdu is experiencing continuous night rain again. Like countless ordinary nights in the past, who am I when I leave with my suitcase at dawn.

When I first reported to university four years ago, I took the high-speed train, which was a long eight hour journey. The train passed through numerous hills and tunnels along the way, and when I entered the Chengdu Plain, the scenery outside the window immediately became clear and clear. The novelty and touch that first arrived at that time can still be felt now.

Later in college, I resisted taking this high-speed train that connected Chengdu and Taiyuan, fearing the constraints and hardships of eight hours. However, after graduating from Chengdu today, I still wanted to take the train. I wanted to review the familiar routes and scenery again, and even more, I wanted to see the hard work and dedication of my high school years at that time, how to take me through the vast sea of people and time, from Shanxi to the land of Southwest China.

In the early morning of Chengdu, it was cloudy and rainy. The train started, accelerated, and let the scenery outside the window fly in my eyes. Go back as you come, perhaps this is also a kind of beginning and ending.
