I'm a fresh graduate student majoring in international communication in Journalism and Communication School of Nanjing University currently. I was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province in 2001. My major entertainments are badminton, volleyball games and American country music. I can play a bit of violin and harmonica. My idol is Taylor Swift, one of the greatest and most awarded singers in the world, and I love every album of hers. I'm always inspired by a piece of her lyrics "You are what you love", and that's my attitude towards my life.In postgraduate period, I participate in several programs which mainly focuses on the field of tourism. I have taken part in some business competitions and also devoted to practical activities. My motto is a saying from the great physicist Stephen Hawking, "while there is life, there ie hope."
