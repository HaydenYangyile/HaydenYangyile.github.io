## Barren Cold

Winter in Qingdao doesn't seem suitable for travel.
Despite being fully prepared before departure, I was still taught a lesson by this sea breeze when I arrived in Qingdao. At the end of the first day, there were indeed signs of catching a cold, so the first stop on the second day's itinerary became the large pharmacy at the corner of the hotel. The first accompanying gift purchased was a box of Gankang and a bag of Vitamin C Yinqiao tablets. The aunt at the pharmacy asked us in surprise, why are you here to travel at this time?

## Winter of Qingdao

Red tiles and green trees, blue sea and blue sky are the business cards of Qingdao, but this season the trees are already bald, the sky is not beautiful, and the blue sky is not very visible, leaving only red tiles and blue sea. But the continuous small hills in the old city area are fresh and delicate, and the sea is tolerant enough. There are also seagulls flying around the beach, picking up crumbs from people's open palms.

## Meaning of Traveling

So why come to Qingdao in winter? The motivation for traveling is unclear, perhaps due to boredom, perhaps because I happen to have time, or perhaps because I haven't seen the sea for too long. The last time I saw the sea was five years ago.
Some people say that traveling is an escape, and I always feel that giving such a heavy meaning to travel will only increase the sense of difference on the way back. But at this moment in Qingdao, I can really escape some things with peace of mind, just face the sea, the rest has nothing to do with me.
